<p>
<em>As the cost of college continues to rise, free community college has
emerged as a strategic policy intervention aimed at improving access to
higher education and alleviating the burden of student loans. While free
community college offers a potentially lower-cost pathway through
college, limiting financial aid exclusively to community colleges might
have unintended consequences if it diverts students from attending
better-resourced 4-year universities, which typically have higher
completion rates. This study examines the impact of the Star
Scholarship, a merit-based program in Chicago offering free community
college tuition for high school graduates with at least a 3.0 GPA. Using
a regression discontinuity design, we find that in the short run, free
community college does not affect whether students enroll in college but
does affect where they attend college, with a noticeable shift from
students starting at 4-year universities after high school to beginning
their higher education at community colleges. However, despite this
initial diversion, in the long run, there is no evidence that becoming a
Star Scholar reduces the probability that a student will eventually
enroll in and complete a bachelor’s degree at a 4-year university. In
fact, we observe positive but imprecise effects on both overall degree
completion and 4-year degree completion six years after high school. At
the same time, we see a 1.7 percentage point increase in the probability
that a student earns a degree from a 2-year institution. Taken together,
these findings suggest that, in our context, free community college
increases overall degree attainment, without leading students to
substitute 2-year degrees for 4-year degrees. Students who are likely to
be from immigrant families have the greatest probability of taking up
the scholarship. This finding highlights a significant gap in support
for immigrant students pursuing higher education. This study contributes
to our broader understanding of how financial aid design affects
economic opportunity for different groups of students, providing
valuable insights for policymakers aiming to increase college access and
success.</em>

<em>Curricular materials not only impart knowledge but also instill
values and shape collective memory. Growth in U.S. school choice
programs has increased public funds directed to religious schools, but
little is known about what they teach. We examine textbooks from
religious educational settings and from public schools in Texas and
California, applying and improving upon computer vision and natural
language processing tools to measure topics, values, representation, and
portrayal over time. Political polarization suggests a narrative of
divergence, but our analysis reveals meaningful parallels between the
public school collections overall, while religious textbooks differ
notably, featuring less female representation, characters with lighter
skin, more White individuals, and differential portrayal of topics such
as evolution and religion. Important similarities, however, also emerge:
for example, each collection portrays females in contexts that are more
positive but less active and powerful than males, and depicts the U.S.
founding era and slavery in similar contexts.</em>

<!-- <p>*Traditional natural language processing tools, which depend on frequent mentions of individual names associated with different identities to measure the context in which different identities are portrayed, have proven effective in uncovering gender bias. However, they fall short in accurately representing other historically marginalized groups due to their infrequent mention. This issue is exacerbated when examining the intersection of two underrepresented groups, whose combined identities are even less represented. To address this limitation, we introduce "Category Embeddings," an innovative approach that leverages traditional word embedding techniques to estimate a single embedding for a set of names associated with a given identity category in contrast to prior approaches that estimate separate embeddings for each individual name. This method enhances the capacity to measure representation of intersectional experiences and significantly improves the accuracy of representation analyses in smaller text samples across all identities. We demonstrate the flexibility of our method through two distinct applications. First, we measure how race-gender identities are portrayed in a century of highly influential children’s books. We find that Black females are most likely associated with struggle and performance arts, Black males with sports and struggle, White females with family and performance arts, and White males with power and business. Second, we measure the representation of queer individuals of different races and genders in two major U.S. newspapers. We find that queer individuals are more likely to be associated with performance arts and less likely to be associated with power than heterosexual individuals of the same race or gender.*</p> -->

<h5><strong>Abstract</strong></h5>
<p>
<em>Books shape how children learn about society and social norms, in
part through the representation of different characters. To better
understand the messages children encounter in books, we introduce new
machine-led methods for systematically converting images into data. We
apply these image tools, along with established text analysis methods,
to measure the representation of race, gender, and age in children’s
books commonly found in US schools and homes over the last century. We
find that books selected to highlight people of color, or females of all
races, consistently depict characters with darker skin tones than
characters in “mainstream” books, which depict lighter-skinned
characters even after conditioning on perceived race. Children are
depicted with lighter skin than adults, despite no biological foundation
for such a difference. Females are more represented in images than in
text, suggesting greater symbolic inclusion in pictures than substantive
inclusion in stories. Relative to the US Census, Black and Latinx people
are underrepresented; whereas males, particularly White males, are
persistently overrepresented. Our data provide a view into the “black
box” of education through children’s books in US schools and homes,
highlighting what has changed and what has endured over time.</em>

<em>The manner in which gender is portrayed in materials used to teach
children conveys messages about people’s roles in society. In this
paper, we measure the gendered depiction of central domains of social
life in 100 years of highly influential children’s books. We make two
main contributions: (1) we find that the portrayal of gender in these
books reproduces traditional gender norms in society, and (2) we publish
StoryWords 1.0, the first word embeddings trained on such a large body
of children’s literature. We find that, relative to males, females are
more likely to be represented in relation to their appearance than in
relation to their competence; second, they are more likely to be
represented in relation to their role in the family than their role in
business. Finally, we find that non-binary or gender-fluid individuals
are rarely mentioned. Our analysis advances understanding of the
different messages contained in content commonly used to teach children,
with immediate applications for practice, policy, and research.</em>

<em>Images in children’s books convey messages about society and the
roles that people play in it. Understanding these messages requires
systematic measurement of who is represented. Computer vision face
detection tools can provide such measurements; however, state-of-the-art
face detection models were trained with photographs, and 80% of images
in children’s books are illustrated; thus existing methods both
misclassify and miss classifying many faces. In this paper, we introduce
a new approach to analyze images using AI tools, resulting in data that
can assess representation of race, gender, and age in both illustrations
and photographs in children’s books.</em>
