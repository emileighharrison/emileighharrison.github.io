## A Year in the Life of a First Year PhD
<font size="2"> The following wordcloud is a visualization of every single problemset I poured over while completing the Harris PhD core curriculum. Specifically, these are the problemsets I worked through while studying Micreconomics, Econometrics, and Game Theory.  

If you hover over the wordcloud below, you can see exactly how many times I typed a specific word into LaTex during the first year of my program. For example, I typed the word "function" 188 times!  

I was a little surprised not to see concavity featured more prominently considering how much time I spent checking second order conditions.
